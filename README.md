# ASP-NET-Subscription-Form
This project is for an magazine subscription in which where I created a subscription page which let the user pick their subscription method and dynmically 
updated the price, whilst also taking in the users detail in which they themselves input, validating the input and then storing the details onto a Kentico database.

These files are uploaded purely for showcasing my ability to use ASP.NET with C# in Kentico CMS in a project.

You will not be able to run this code as this code is a fragement of a larger website, therefor there is no CSS to this page either as this was part of a larger
CSS document and I was not able to extract it. However I did work on the CSS for the actual live webpage. Additionally for privacy reasons, the database 
connections have been removed and replaced with dummy data.
